# Smart-Energy-Managment
AI based smart Energy Management system which uses Machine Learning techniques to optimize energy consumption in real-time. The system systematically analysis the usage pattern, predicts the demands and distributes the energy with maximum efficiency. Using smart AI algorithms, it ensures cost-effective and sustainable energy uses. 

Some of the features are,
Real-Time Energy Monitering - Tracks the energy comsumption using IoT based sensors.
AI-Powered Prediction - Uses Machine Learning models like LSTM, SVM, etc.,
Automated Load Management - Optimized energy distribution for all the system.
Anamoly Detection - Easy identification of unwanted and unusual energy comsumption patterns.
